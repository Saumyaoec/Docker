#what is docker ?
Ans: So docker is a file and the docker file is a file that contains a list of instructions that docker
     should follow when creating our image
# Docker have two stage 
1. build stage 
2. run stage 

1. build stage  ###A stage is the creation an image. In a multi-stage build, you go through the process of creating
more than one image, however you typically only tag a single one (exceptions being multiple builds, building 
a multi-architecture image manifest with a tool like buildx, and anything else docker releases after this answer).

2.run stage    ###
